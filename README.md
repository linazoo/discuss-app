# Conversation App 

"Is conversation a lost art?" 
How do we open ourselves up to a changing our points of view during a conversation with someone else with opposite point of view? 

This is an app that will let you engage in a conversation that flows out someone's point of view - someone who is willing to have their mind changed. 

Inspired by the Reddit thread "CMV"
